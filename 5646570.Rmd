<b>Recommendations for Stall Placement Based on Footfall Analysis</b>

Based on the results of the statistical analysis and t-tests comparing footfall at Coney Street and Stonegate, the following recommendations are made to enhance passerby engagement:

<b>1. Weekday Stall Placement:</b>
#According to statistical findings, there is <b>substantial evidence to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05</b>, which would show that there is a significant difference in footfall between the two locations.

<b>*Coney Street*</b> is the optimal location for setting up the stall during *weekdays*. The analysis indicates a statistically significant higher footfall in this area compared to Stonegate, maximizing visibility and increasing the likelihood of customer engagement. <b>This suggests that businesses looking to maximize visibility and engagement should prioritize stall placements on Coney Street during weekdays</b>.


<b>2. Weekend Stall Placement:</b>
<b>*For weekend placements*</b>, <b>*either Coney Street or Stonegate*</b> would be viable options, as there is no significant difference in footfall between the two locations. <b>*However, if the stall is positioned on Coney Street during the weekdays, it may be advantageous to move it to Stonegate over the weekend*</b>. This strategy would create a balanced customer engagement opportunity across both areas.

Additional logistical considerations, such as access, available space, and the demographics of the target audience, should also be factored into the final decision-making process.


#Limitations
The analysis is based on footfall data collected in 2019, which may not reflect current trends due to changes in local infrastructure or events. Additionally, footfall might be influenced by seasonal variations and special events not accounted for in this dataset.

<b>Report Summary</b>: Footfall Analysis for Optimal Stall Placement
This analysis reviews pedestrian footfall data across York's main locations, pinpointing Coney Street as ideal for weekday stalls and either Coney Street or Stonegate for weekend placements to maximize engagement. The data includes daily footfall counts from 2019, allowing us to analyse broad trends and peak pedestrian times.

A statistical analysis was carried out to compare footfall trends between these two venues on weekdays and weekends.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("histogram_footfall_2019.png")
```

<b>Description for the histogram</b>

This histogram displays the distribution of daily footfall across locations in 2019. Higher peaks at Coney Street suggest higher foot traffic compared to other locations.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("boxplot_footfall_2019.png")
```

<b>This boxplot</b> compares the daily footfall distributions across locations. Coney Street shows a consistently higher median footfall on weekdays, indicating its suitability for weekday stall placement

<b>*Key findings:*</b> 
<b>*Weekday Footfall Comparison*</b>: According to statistical studies, <b>*Coney Street*</b> has much higher average weekday footfall (20,817.45) than Stonegate. This study indicates that establishing a stand on Coney Street throughout the week would likely result in higher pedestrian exposure than on Stonegate.

<b>*Weekend Footfall Comparison*</b>: On weekends, the footfall averages on Coney Street (25,863.37) and Stonegate (26,166.96) are statistically comparable, with no significant difference. As a result, either location might be picked during weekends, as both are expected to have equivalent foot traffic levels.

# Preparinging the data for bar plot
# Calculating means and standard errors for footfall counts
#The code calculates the mean and standard error (SE) of the footfall counts for each location. This helps in visualizing the average while accounting for variability.
summary_data <- York_footfall_coney_stonegate %>%
  group_by(LocationName) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Footfall = mean(TotalCount),
    SE = sd(TotalCount) / sqrt(n())
  )

# Creating a bar plot with error bars
#The geom_bar() function creates bars representing the average footfall for Coney Street and Stonegate, while geom_errorbar() adds error bars to show the uncertainty around the mean estimates.
ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = LocationName, y = Mean_Footfall, fill = LocationName)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(), width = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Mean_Footfall - SE, ymax = Mean_Footfall + SE), 
                width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(0.7)) +
  labs(title = "Average Footfall Comparison: Coney Street vs. Stonegate",
       x = "Location",
       y = "Average Daily Footfall Count",
       fill = "Location") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```


<b>*Recommendations:*</b>
By presenting the average footfall counts with error bars in this manner, we can understand the footfall patterns and can further make discussion on how to optimize operations, marketing efforts, or crowd management strategies based on observed footfall trends.

<b>*Weekday Placement:*</b> Given Coney Street's higher weekday footfall, this location is recommended for maximum engagement with passing people.

<b>*Weekend Placement:*</b> For weekend days, either Coney Street or Stonegate would be appropriate for stall placement, allowing for additional logistical considerations such as space and accessibility.


<b> *These recommendations are based on robust data comparisons and provide an opportunity to strategically maximise footfall engagement for promotional initiatives.* </b>
